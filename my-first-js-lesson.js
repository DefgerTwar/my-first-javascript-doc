//we are defining the today's weather in kelvin//
var kelvin = 293;
// celsius is kelvin minus 273, so it takes the kelvin amount minus 273
let celsius = kelvin - 273;
/* Here we create a new var called fahrenheit, which we place with celsius to fahrenheit formula.
Aftar that we make the number round since many decimals exist, initially i did an row with math.round after the calculation but afterwards i thought i could make the formula inside the method. it worked!//
const fahrenheit = Math.round(celsius * (9/5) + 32);
//string interpolation to print out how is the weather in fahrenheit//
console.log(`The temperature is ${fahrenheit} degrees Fahrenheit`);

//here we define the newton variable and make the calculation go round(no decimals) after it is finished//
const newton = Math.round(celsius * (33/100));
//string interpolation again to print out the newton's value//
console.log(`The newton scale transformed from celsius is ${newton}`);

// Lesson went flawlessly, I think I easily learned the concepts.//
